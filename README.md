# LaunchAnalysis-PaintDryTimer

NASA Launch Analysis:

NASALaunchAnalysis.cpp reads in the data from the CSV file "Space_Corrected.csv" and extracts the time of day to compute the average prior to printing it out.

Paint Dry Timer:

PaintDryTimer.cpp computes and tracks the time for batches of things. One thing takes n seconds to dry, where n is the surface area of the thing (assume a sphere) in centimeters.

TimeCodeTests.cpp is a program for testing that the bounds of each function in TimeCode is working properly.
